This bug occurs when using the Expo Camera API with custom image processing.  The issue arises when attempting to access pixel data from the captured image.  Specifically, the returned image data is sometimes unexpectedly empty or null, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior in the image processing pipeline. This often happens inconsistently, making debugging difficult.  The problem is exacerbated when using features like `takePictureAsync` with specific resolutions or aspect ratios.
