# Expo Camera: Inconsistent Empty Image Data Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API.  The `takePictureAsync` function sometimes returns an image object with empty pixel data, leading to unexpected application behavior. This problem is intermittent and seems to be related to specific image capture settings (resolution, aspect ratio). The solution provided addresses this issue by implementing robust error handling and data validation to gracefully handle cases where empty image data is received. 

## Reproducing the Bug

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the project using Expo Go or a similar Expo development environment.
3. Attempt to capture multiple images using the app.
4. Observe that, on occasion, the image processing will fail due to receiving empty image data from the Expo Camera API.

## Solution

The solution provided in `cameraBugSolution.js` implements checks to ensure image data is valid before processing.  This includes verifying that the data exists and has the expected structure.  The improved error handling prevents the app from crashing and provides more informative feedback to the user.
